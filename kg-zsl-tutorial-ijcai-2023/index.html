            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>
                Zero-shot Learning (ZSL), which enables machine learning models to predict new targets without
                seeing their training samples, has attracted wide research interests in many communities
                such as computer vision (CV) and natural language processing (NLP).
                An effective solution is to use external knowledge such as text, attribute descriptions and
                Knowledge Graphs (KGs) to bridge the gap between the targets with training samples and
                the targets without training samples. This tutorial aims to introduce ZSL
                from the perspective of KG, by presenting different kinds of paradigms, studies and
                resources for addressing ZSL in different tasks including image classification,
                visual question answering and KG completion.
                This tutorial is a new edit of <a href="https://china-uk-zsl.github.io/kg-zsl-tutorial-iswc-2022/">the K-ZSL tutorial in ISWC'22</a>,
                with many new contents such as the recent transformer-based methods.

            <p>
                This tutorial is suitable for AI researchers of all levels,
                especially those (1) who are to enter the domain of machine learning with sample shortage,
                (2) who have already been working on this topic but are interested in solutions utilizing knowledge representation and reasoning,
                and (3) who are working on Knowledge Graph, semantic techniques and their applications.
                The audiences are expected to have some basic knowledge on machine learning, and some simple background on semantic techniques including Resource Description Framework (RDF) and RDF Schema.

                is a chair of the Knowledge Graph Group at the Alan Turing Institute and is a member of the School of Informatics at The University of Edinburgh. He received his Ph.D. in Computer Science from The University of Manchester in 2004. His research focuses primarily on knowledge representation and artificial intelligence, in particular on knowledge based learning and reasoning, and knowledge based natural language understanding and generations, as well as their applications, such as those in information retrieval, healthcare, software engineering, and open science. He is the first author of the first book on Knowledge Graph and the Chief Scientist and Coordinator of the first EU Marie-Curie project on Knowledge Graph (i.e., the K-Drive project). He has 7 publications on this topic in leading conferences and journals, such as IJCAI, AAAI, WWW, KDD, KR, ISWC and the Journal of Web Semantics. He is an Editor of the Journal of Web Semantics (JoWS) and a Program Chair of the 19th International Semantic Web Conference (ISWC 2020), the premier international forum for the Semantic Web / Knowledge Graph / Linked Data communities.
